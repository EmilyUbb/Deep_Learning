#### Determining the Edibility of Wild Plants
Emily Ubbelode

### Need: 
With the ever growing world population, and the effect traditional growing practices have on the environment foraging is becoming ever important. Knowing what plants are edible, and which are poisonous is a big hurdle for new foragers to overcome. I am planning to build an image classification model that can accurately determine from an image if a plant is edible or not. This would be a useful tool for new foragers to use, and will hopefully help encourage more people to forage for their food instead of solely relying on traditional farming methods. 

### Data:
I am working on scraping data on poisonous, edible and inedible mushrooms from mushroomworld.com. If I am unable to successfully accomplish that by the end of day Thursday, I have two options, pre written code that scrapes mushroom data from another website, or a kaggle dataset on edible wild plants. 


### Tools: 
Web scraping using selenium and beautiful soup 
Python neural network libraries such as keras
Modeling using matplotlib and SK Learn


### MVP Goal
Have a neural network that can accurately predict if an image is of either an edible or inedible wild plant. The most important accuracy factor I will be focused on is minimizing the number of inedible plants labeled as edible.
