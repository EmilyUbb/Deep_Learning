## Determining if a Mushroom is Edible or Poisonous 
##### Emily Ubbelohde



The majority of my work so far has centered around scraping my images and then preprocessing them in keras. After completing that I was able to get my images loaded into both a training and validation set of data and have started running a baseline model.

Once my baseline model has completed I will work to improve precision in my model for classifying mushrooms by type. Once I am satisfied with those results I will begin to build my pipeline that then determines if the mushroom is poisonous or edible. This should be a fairly straightforward part of the process. 

Note: My baseline model is currently still running.
